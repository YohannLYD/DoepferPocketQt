# DoepferPocketQt
**v0.1.0**

## Why this app?
As [pocketEditor](http://www.doepfer.de/controller/Pocket/pocketeditor.htm) is only available for Windows, this app allows macOS/Linux users to configure their controller without having to run after a Windows PC.

## Description
DoepferPocketQt allows you to edit the presets of the [Pocket Electronic](http://www.doepfer.de/pe.htm) based controllers (pocketControl, pocketDial, pocketFader, A-192-1).


## TODO
* Create a visual piano keyboard to select the note for pitch related events
* Replace the parameter values (0-127) by the their name accordingly to the selected event
* Add a feature to open/save presets from/to a MIDI file compatible with pocketEditor

## Dependencies
* QMidi (included)
* Qt 5.7 or above
